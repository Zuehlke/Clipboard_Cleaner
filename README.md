# Clipboard Cleaner for macOS

## About

Have you ever been annoyed that when you copy text, styling information is often retained? Have you already copied your text to a text editor as an intermediate step to get rid of the styling information? Then this app might be the solution. The clipboard is permanently monitored and any styling information is directly removed.
